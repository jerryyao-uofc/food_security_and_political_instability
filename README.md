EMCA 31330 Final Report Understanding Food Security, Undernourishment, and Political Stability: A Supervised Machine Learning and Data-Driven Approach

Agriculture accounts for a comparatively small share of the global economy, but remains central in shaping
the economic, health, and political scene of a nation. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations (FAO), many regions in the world with variable food supplies can be considered
“food insecure”, where individual persons do not consume a sufficient amount of calories (dietary energy)
on a regular basis to lead a normal, active and healthy life.It has also been documented that warfare
and other types of political instability is also related with critical ’staple crops’ (crops such as maize, wheat,
or rice) or ’cash-crops’ (such as coffee, cocoa, tea etc.) is also plays into political instability. For example,
the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism (START) documents that the ’green gold rush’ of
avocado production has become increasingly lucrative for cartels, and bolsters the cartel’s income stream
via violent extortion. 

Motivated by these important facts related to the agricultural sector, our report seeks to utilize supervised
machine learning techniques to find critical factors driving undernourishment and political instability with
a focus on agricultural composition. Current literature provides theories and traditional econometric work
that elucidate the complex relations between crops, income, emissions, undernourishment, and political
stability. In this report, we will be taking an agnostic approach to understand how different features in the
agricultural sector, supported by different economic conditions and environmental variables, may co-move
and be used to understand and even predict the undernourishment level and political stability. In particular,
econometric investigation will have two primary components: 1) Interpretation and Comparison with
present literature, and 2) Predictions of undernourishment levels and political stability levels of a nation.

In the repository, we present our notebooks for datasets, dataprocessing, merging steps and regression results.
